General outline for project (preliminary)

generate a data set:
    a. Randomly cropped images (decide up to what extent) labled with position (or -1 if OOD)
    b. Each image should be cropped to different sizes (e.g. to 4,6 and 10 pieces)
    c. Decide how "sets" are marked (i.e. the true n crops of a pic together with some OOD crops)
    
Model Architecture (food for thought):
    a. Conv net for each crop generating an embedding vector
    b. Bidrectional RNN model (padded to max crop size?) seq-2-seq
    c. Assignment matrix output (a t^2 by t^2 matrix where cell [2,3] is the probability of crop 2 assignmed to slot 3) - should be normalized row and vector wise
    d. Loss function? other metrics?
    
Utilities:
    a. crop-2-image function (generating an image from n crops)
    b. Evaluate and predict routines - input an set of crops and output an image (or even input an image and t cuts)
    c....
